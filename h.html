	<p><b>Reading this page is very important</b></p>
	<p>if you are a Minecraft player you must to know, this game is very harder than Minecraft.</p>
	<p>you will know this when you play the game</p>
	<h3>Important things is Urminaca:</h3>
	<p><b>1-Food</b></p>
	<p>in Urminaca Foods are just a bit rarer than other games. runing and climbing up</p>
	<p>makes you very hungry. so, Food is very important. but after the 0.1 vertion, developers fix that.</p>
	<p>now jumping and other things makes you not very hungry.</p>
	<p><b>2-House</b></p>
	<p>in nights many Monsters will spawn around you. so, you need a safe space.</p>
	<p><b>3- Ores</b></p>
	<p>mining ores needs a formol. if you click on F5, you can see your pos in your world.</p>
	<p>for example pos:(160, -12.5, 330)</p>
	<p>the middle number is important. you can find Ores betwean -450 to -2000 and more.</p>
	<p>you must to mine a hole or go to a cave. caves are a little freaky and risky.</p>
	<p>My suggestion: Do this step by step</p>
	<p>1- find 200-300 foods</p>
	<p>2- mine 250 plocks per day(in game)</p>
	<p>3- when you find 9 mese crystal and some enouogh irons, make a Travelent_box and plac it in the cave and add a name on it</p>
	<p>4- go up to your home and make an other Travelet_box and place it in your home. add a name on it. now when you click on your</p>
	<p>travelet_box, you can see you an other travelet boxes. when you click on a name in your travelet box, you will fast travel to that.</p>
	<p>you can find very very good ores under the -2000. in stairs form mining you can go 1 block under the ground</p>
	<p>per 2 scounds with a stone pickaxe. 2*2000=4000, so you need 4000 secounds time for mining. 4000/60 ~ 67.</p>
	<p>so you must to mine one and a half houre for go to -2000</p>
